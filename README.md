# Hand-Controlled Sand Simulation

This project is a real-time, interactive particle simulation where you can control a cloud of sand-like particles using your hand gestures, captured through a webcam. The particles are designed to flow and react dynamically to your hand's position and movement, creating a visually engaging and fluid experience.

## Features

- **Real-Time Hand Tracking:** Utilizes the MediaPipe library to accurately track your hand's position.
- **Interactive Particle Physics:** Particles are influenced by your hand's movements, creating a "wind" effect that pushes them around.
- **Gesture Control:** Pause the simulation by making a fist and resume by opening your hand.
- **Minimalistic UI:** A clean and simple interface that focuses on the visual experience.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- MediaPipe

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    ```

2.  **Install the required libraries:**
    ```bash
    pip install opencv-python numpy mediapipe
    ```

## How to Run

1.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd path/to/your/project
    ```

2.  **Run the script:**
    ```bash
    python hand_sand.py
    ```

3.  **Interact with the simulation:**
    -   **Move your hand** to influence the particles.
    -   **Make a fist** to pause the simulation.
    -   **Open your hand** to resume.
    -   Press **'q'** to quit the application.
